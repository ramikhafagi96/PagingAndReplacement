# PagingAndReplacement
## Objective
1. Implementing several page replacement algorithms.
2. Evaluating several page replacement algorithms.
## Description
The required algorithms to be implemented are as follows:
* First In First Out (FIFO)
* Least Recently Used (LRU)
* Clock

For each run:
1. A trace recording page faults for each memory reference in the sequence.
2. Counter recording total page faults.
